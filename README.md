### Prerequisites: 
  - [Node v16](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)

This repository will only contain the contracts which I have personally written code for. To include the required dependencies, clone the scaffold-eth repository and include these files for the corresponding challenges.

Clone the scaffold-eth repository:

git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-challenges.git
